might be located at /etc/velvettools/dtbs or /boot/dtbs
you can create it yourself

inside you can put stuff like
- "sc7180-trogdor-*.dtb" for multiple files that match
- "sc7180-trogdor-r1.dtb" for single file (if you are sure that's the correct one)
- (not working for now)"sc7180-trogdor-r1.dtb sc7180-trogdor-r1-lte.dtb" for specyfic multiple files

Note. each dtb seams to add more or less 0.09 MiB to image size
Note. all available dtb's are loacated at /boot/dtb-(version)/
Tip. you can try to figure out the correct one with "cat /proc/device-tree/model"
